pick out apis to test with
-- headers
-- cookies - need to find test
-- bodies ***
-- path param
-- query param

difference * and Any
Needed for mvp release:
- readable output flagging 500s
-- output to file
-- summary of results
-- reading file back in for new run
- testing/experimenting
-- leaving empty vs null 'endpoints'
- change swagger url to swagger location
- packaging jar or docker

multi thread runner/make async

difference between query param = null and not including param
-- analagous problem for request body/body fields?

POST /pet photoUrls in body - how to handle Valid urls?
- allowed through config file

share test parameter mock code

parameter to print runs

formdata support additionalMetadata- /pet/{petId}/uploadImage
support cookies

support date types(read "date" in name)

generate random list input - how to store sub-types?
-- nested parameter spec?

required parameters

figure out content-type header

less copy and paste for config

can min/max be exclusive? -yes
don't pass results to a global?

allow passing in static value for parameter
-- should be able to be always or % of the time used

read from result global in input gen
give TestResults awareness of ids
passing Ids forward to next "chain" of api

should endpointSpec have a generator function for each parameter?
output to file

make ParameterSpec/paramInfo more strongly typed

play with inlines in shapeEndpoint
break up ResultsStateGlobalTest function
consolidate results saveToGlobal and results GlobalState saveToGlobal

test other parameter types- need to find endpoints
other parameter type generation
set up a db

make all test input concretion values strings!


------next big picture------
include reading test result for input - while input is generated
request body generation
allow org.shaper.config of num tests
smarten up test case generation - searching for vals w/ prev results
