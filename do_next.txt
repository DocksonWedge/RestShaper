Do we need ParamPosition anymore or can we use iterator? - I think we leave it for now.

read from result global in input gen

make ParameterSpec more strongly typed

play with inlines in shapeEndpoint
break up ResultsStateGlobalTest function
consolidate results saveToGlobal and results GlobalState saveToGlobal

create test result serializer/create test result output to file
test other parameter types- need to find endpoints
other parameter type generation
set up a db

mock `Test callWithConcretion successfully calls an endpoint`

------next big picture------
include reading test result for input - while input is generated
request body generation
allow config of num tests
smarten up test case generation - searching for vals w/ prev results
