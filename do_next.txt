pick out apis to test with
-- headers
-- cookies - need to find test
-- bodies ***
-- path param
-- query param

difference * and Any
Needed for mvp release:
- force valid and invalid values
- passing concrete header in - for auth
- readable output flagging 500s
-- output to file
-- summary of results
-- reading file back in for new run
- call chaining
-- track the CALL (e.g. GET /pet) that retrieved a result (eventually prevent looping and report on the call chain.
-- TEST CHAINING! basic chaining should work for strings
--- match between pascal case and snake case for response
-- saving and using full objects and arrays

- testing/experimenting
-- leaving empty vs null 'endpoints'
- change swagger url to swagger location
- packaging jar or docker

handle undefined response fields

multi thread runner/make async

replace println's with real loggers


difference between query param = null and not including param
-- analagous problem for request body/body fields?
multi thread running
need runId to determine current information to use?
POST /pet photoUrls in body - how to handle Valid urls?
- allowed through config file

share test parameter mock code

parameter to print runs
share the example spec url in tests rather than paste everywhere

formdata support additionalMetadata- /pet/{petId}/uploadImage
support cookies
handle multiple request schemas
support date types(read "date" in name)

generate random list input - how to store sub-types?
-- nested parameter spec?

required parameters
`Test Categories field in request body is an object` test is flaky
figure out content-type header

less copy and paste for config

can min/max be exclusive? -yes
don't pass results to a global?

allow passing in static value for parameter
-- should be able to be always or % of the time used

read from result global in input gen
give TestResults awareness of ids
passing Ids forward to next "chain" of api

should endpointSpec have a generator function for each parameter?
output to file

make ParameterSpec/paramInfo more strongly typed

play with inlines in shapeEndpoint
break up ResultsStateGlobalTest function
consolidate results saveToGlobal and results GlobalState saveToGlobal

test other parameter types- need to find endpoints
other parameter type generation
set up a db

make all test input concretion values strings!


------next big picture------
include reading test result for input - while input is generated
request body generation
allow org.shaper.config of num tests
smarten up test case generation - searching for vals w/ prev results
