figure out what to do with num cases
create test result serializer/create test result output to file

make all test input concretion values strings!
make non-deterministic tests deterministic D:

read from result global in input gen

make ParameterSpec more strongly typed


give TestResults awareness of ids
passing Ids forward to next "chain" of api

play with inlines in shapeEndpoint
break up ResultsStateGlobalTest function
consolidate results saveToGlobal and results GlobalState saveToGlobal


test other parameter types- need to find endpoints
other parameter type generation
set up a db

mock `Test callWithConcretion successfully calls an endpoint`

------next big picture------
include reading test result for input - while input is generated
request body generation
allow org.shaper.config of num tests
smarten up test case generation - searching for vals w/ prev results
