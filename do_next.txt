Do we need ParamPosition anymore or can we use iterator? - I think we leave it for now.

read from result global in input gen

create test result serializer/create test result output to file
test other parameter types- need to find endpoints
other parameter type generation
set up a db

mock `Test callWithConcretion successfully calls an endpoint`

------next big picture------
include reading test result for input - while input is generated
request body generation
allow config of num tests
smarten up test case generation - searching for vals w/ prev results
